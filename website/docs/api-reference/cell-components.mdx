# Cell component props

Cell components are used to render each individual cells of a column:
```tsx
const MyCellComponent = ({ rowData, setRowData }) => {
  // Render a cell reflecting the value of `rowData` and update it using `setRowData`
}

const columns = [{ title: 'A', component: MyCellComponent }]
```

## Data
### rowData
> Type: `any`

The row object from which tha value of the cell should be extracted. Make sur to
[use `keyColumn`](../performance/cell-components#use-keycolumn) if you do not need the entire row object.

### setRowData
> Type: `(rowData) => void`

This function should be called to update the row with its new value.

## Extra information
### rowIndex
> Type: `number`

Index of the row.

### columnIndex
> Type: `number`

Index of the column.

### columnData
> Type: `any`

The column's data. [More details](columns#columndata)

## Cell state
Try editing a cell to see the difference between `active` and `focus`:
<ActiveFocus />

### active
> Type: `boolean`

True when the cell is active / highlighted.

It is recommended to hide any placeholder while a cell is not active to avoid having an entire empty column with the
same text repeating.

### focus
> Type: `boolean`

True when the cell is focused / being edited.

It is recommended to apply style `pointerEvents: none` to your components while they are not in focus
to prevent any unwanted interactions or cursor.

### disabled
> Type: `boolean`

True when the cell is disabled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Control functions
### stopEditing
> Type: `({ nextRow = true }) => void`

This function can be called to exit edit mode programmatically. This is mainly used when `disableKeys` is true
but it can have other use-cases.

Optionally you can pass the `nextRow` parameter to `false` so the active / highlighted cell stays on the current
cell instead of going to the next row.

### insertRowBelow
> Type: `() => void`

This function can be called to insert a row below the current one.

### duplicateRow
> Type: `() => void`

This function can be called to duplicate the current row.

### deleteRow
> Type: `() => void`

This function can be called to delete the current row.

### getContextMenuItems
> Type: `() => ContextMenuItem[]`

This function can be called to get the list of available context menu items (insert row, duplicate selected rows...).
