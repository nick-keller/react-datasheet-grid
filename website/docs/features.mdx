strict minimum, follow the [performance guides](performance/static-vs-dynamic) to get the most out of DSG.

## Copy pasting
<div class="text--center">
    <img src="/img/copy-paste.gif" alt="Copy pasting demo" />
</div>

Copy pasting to and from Excel, Google-sheet, and other spreadsheet software is supported and completely customizable:
you decide what data is copied and how pasting is handled with simple functions.
[More details](api-reference/columns#copy-pasting) on how to customize copy pasting behavior.

## Expanding selection
<div class="text--center">
    <img src="/img/expand-selection.gif" alt="Expanding selection demo" />
</div>

Expanding the selection is supported and can be disabled. It does not require any additional work it to work. Try it out
on other examples!

## Lock rows
It might be desirable to lock rows. Here the user cannot insert or delete rows, even when using keyboard shortcuts or
when pasting large data-set. [More details](api-reference/props#options) on grid options.

<LockRows />

## Disable columns or cells
Columns can be disabled entirely, or on a per-row basis.

Disabling a column prevents the user from editing its cells, including any pasting or deleting operation.
The user can still copy the value of a disabled column. [More details](api-reference/columns#disabled) on
disabling columns and cells.

Try toggling the "active" column:
